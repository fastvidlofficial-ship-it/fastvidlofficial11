          <h3>3. Content Ownership and Copyright</h3>
          <p className="disclaimer-text">
            All videos, photos, Stories, Reels, IGTV, and other media content accessible through FastVidl are owned by their original creators, publishers, or rights holders. FastVidl does not claim ownership of any downloaded content, does not host or store downloaded media files, acts solely as a technical facilitator for downloads, and bears no responsibility for the copyright status of content.
          </p>
          <p className="disclaimer-text">
            You are solely responsible for ensuring that you possess necessary rights or permissions to download Instagram content, your use of downloaded content complies with applicable copyright laws, you obtain appropriate licenses for any commercial use, and you respect the intellectual property rights of content creators.
          </p>
          <p className="disclaimer-text">
            Downloading copyrighted material from Instagram without authorization may violate The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), international copyright treaties and conventions, local copyright laws in your jurisdiction, and Instagram’s Terms of Service. FastVidl does not encourage, endorse, or condone copyright infringement. Users who violate copyright laws do so at their own legal risk.
          </p>

          <h3>4. No Legal, Professional, or Expert Advice</h3>
          <p className="disclaimer-text">
            FastVidl does not provide legal advice regarding copyright or intellectual property matters, professional consultation on content usage rights, expert guidance on compliance with Instagram’s Terms of Service, or recommendations on lawful versus unlawful downloading activities. For questions about your legal rights and obligations, consult a qualified attorney in your jurisdiction.
          </p>

          <h3>5. Service Accuracy and Reliability</h3>
          <p className="disclaimer-text">
            We do not warrant or guarantee that our Service will function without interruption or errors, download links will always work correctly, downloaded content will be in expected format or quality, all features will be available at all times, or Instagram content will remain accessible.
          </p>
          <p className="disclaimer-text">
            FastVidl’s functionality depends on Instagram’s public data access policies, external server performance, internet connectivity stability, and platform policy changes or restrictions. We cannot control these external factors and are not liable for service disruptions resulting from them.
          </p>

          <h3>6. User Responsibility and Assumption of Risk</h3>
          <p className="disclaimer-text">
            By using FastVidl, you acknowledge that you use our Service entirely at your own risk, you are responsible for evaluating content before downloading, you must verify compliance with all applicable laws, and you bear all consequences of your downloading activities.
          </p>
          <p className="disclaimer-text">
            You are independently responsible for reading and understanding Instagram’s Terms of Service, complying with its community guidelines and policies, accepting consequences of violating those rules, and understanding that downloading may violate Instagram’s usage terms. FastVidl is not responsible if your downloading activities result in account suspension, termination, or other penalties from Instagram.
          </p>

          <h3>7. Content Appropriateness</h3>
          <p className="disclaimer-text">
            FastVidl does not review or pre-screen downloadable Instagram content, monitor what users choose to download, filter content based on appropriateness or legality, or control what content Instagram users upload or share publicly.
          </p>
          <p className="disclaimer-text">
            You acknowledge that content available through Instagram may be unsuitable for certain audiences, contain offensive, explicit, or disturbing material, violate community standards or ethical norms, or be inaccurate, misleading, or false. Exercise appropriate discretion and judgment when selecting content to download.
          </p>

          <h3>8. External Links and Third-Party Services</h3>
          <p className="disclaimer-text">
            Links to external websites or references to third-party services do not constitute endorsement of those sites or services, verification of accuracy of external information, approval of third-party business practices, or responsibility for third-party content or policies.
          </p>
          <p className="disclaimer-text">
            You should independently evaluate external websites before using them, review privacy policies of third-party services, verify credibility of linked resources, and exercise caution with unfamiliar platforms.
          </p>

          <h3>9. Security and Malware Disclaimer</h3>
          <p className="disclaimer-text">
            While we implement reasonable security measures, we cannot guarantee that downloaded Instagram files are free from viruses or malware, our Service is immune to security vulnerabilities, Instagram content is always safe to download, or your device will not be compromised.
          </p>
          <p className="disclaimer-text">
            You are responsible for maintaining up-to-date antivirus and security software, scanning downloaded files for threats, implementing appropriate security measures on your devices, and backing up important data before downloading unfamiliar content.
          </p>

          <h3>10. Availability and Service Continuity</h3>
          <p className="disclaimer-text">
            FastVidl may experience temporary or permanent service interruptions, scheduled or emergency maintenance periods, performance degradation during high-traffic periods, or complete discontinuation at any time without notice.
          </p>
          <p className="disclaimer-text">
            We reserve the right to add, modify, or remove features without warning, discontinue support for certain Instagram functionalities, change download limits or restrictions, and alter functionality based on technical or legal considerations.
          </p>

          <h3>11. Jurisdictional Variations</h3>
          <p className="disclaimer-text">
            FastVidl is accessible internationally, but laws regarding Instagram content downloading vary by jurisdiction. You must comply with laws in your specific location, and we make no representation that our Service is appropriate or legal everywhere.
          </p>
          <p className="disclaimer-text">
            You are solely responsible for understanding laws applicable in your jurisdiction, ensuring your activities comply with local regulations, obtaining necessary permissions or licenses if required, and accepting consequences of violating local laws.
          </p>

          <h3>12. Fair Use Considerations</h3>
          <p className="disclaimer-text">
            Some jurisdictions recognize "fair use" or "fair dealing" exceptions to copyright law for personal, non-commercial purposes, educational activities, critical commentary or research, and transformative creative works.
          </p>
          <p className="disclaimer-text">
            FastVidl does not and cannot determine whether your use qualifies as "fair use," provide legal opinions on copyright exceptions, guarantee that any particular use is lawful, or shield you from legal consequences. Fair use is a complex legal doctrine that depends on specific circumstances. Consult legal counsel if you have questions.
          </p>

          <h3>13. Limitation of Liability</h3>
            <p className="disclaimer-text">

      "as-is" basis; we disclaim all warranties, express or implied. We are not
      liable for any damages arising from service use, and users assume all risks

          </p>

          <h3>16. No Waiver of Rights</h3>
          <p className="disclaimer-text">
